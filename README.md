## Overview

You will be designing and implementing a multi-step form process for brand creation, focusing on front-end implementation using HTML, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI (or Radix). You may need to use some vanilla JavaScript or jQuery when absolutely necessary.
The purpose of this brand creation multi-step form is to collect all the necessary branding assets from a user's business. Along with this assignment you will have received an example branded Powerpoint presentation. The brand assets your forms collect need to be comprehensive enough that a similar Powerpoint presentation could be created for the user.


## Time Limit

   - Follow the instructions to create the pull request.

## Requirements

1. **Multi-step form process**
   - Break down the brand creation into logical steps (e.g., Basic Info, Visual Identity)
   - Implement navigation between steps

2. **Required branding elements:**
   - Company name and logo
   - Brand colors
   - Heading and body type fonts
   - 1 or more additional elements you see fit

   - Text inputs
   - Color pickers

## Technical Stack

- HTML5 and web components for structure.
